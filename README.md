# Left Hand

A WebExtensions plugin to adapt websites for left-handed use.

I'm sure you know how being left-handed is like. You're holding your phone, you want to close an image preview in DuckDuckGo's search results, but it's on the far top right of the page, and you're holding your phone with your left hand. But wait—it gets worse. If you're a phablet user (like me and my Note20 Ultra), then you actually can't reach the button so you have to lift your right hand just to close that damn button. Sure, there's that `Back` button on Android but there are times when it won't work as expected on DuckDuckGo.

Well, here's a plugin to fix our leftie woes. Unfortunately, Firefox does not yet support arbitrary plugins on mobile, so you'll have to find a way to make it run on your phone.

## Website support

- DuckDuckGo
    - Image preview close button on left
    - Search bar `search` and `clear` buttons on left
    - `settings` and `menu` buttons switched places
    - Image icons are properly left-ified (flipped horizontally)

That's it for now. Feel free to submit a pull request if you want to support your favorite website. I'll be adding more website support in the future.
